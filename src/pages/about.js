        <h1>Information & Interactivity</h1>
        <p>
          Encoded Objects explores how information and interactivity can augment
          our understandings of image & object making. These investigations
          re-envision our current conditions by considering the history of art
          and information through a technological lens. Founding members{" "}

          integrate their varied experiences by merging the physical and digital
          realms into singular works of art.

        <h1>Artist Bios</h1>
        <p>
          Mike Hadley is an artist, software developer, and educator based out
          of Chicago, IL. Mike works and teaches at the intersection of art,
          technology and science. With training in both Art and Computational
          Neuroscience, he supports his art practice with a mixture of critical
          & technological skills. Mike is interested in revealing hidden systems
          and probing their implications - whether it is the process of genetic
          engineering caffeine into food or excavating the heated arguments
          between Wikipedia editors.

          Jonathan Rockford lives and works in South Florida. With a background
          in sculpture, ceramics, fine-woodworking, and video art, Jonathan is
          also intensely interested in the confluence of the physical and
          digital in our daily lives. When he is not teaching Art and Art
          History, he can be found listening to audiobooks & podcasts while
          working in the studio, cultivating his butterfly garden, or lounging
          with feline friends.
