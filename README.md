# Encoded Objects Website

Build with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Installation

Clone or download the repository. Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Open a terminal in the repository folder and run:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

Everything is controlled via npm scripts, so open up a terminal in the repository folder and run one of the following:

- `npm run dev` - this will build a development version of the site and host it at <http://localhost:8000>.
- `npm run deploy` - this will rebuild the site and push any changes live to the master branch on GitHub, which will update <http://www.encodedobjects.com/>

## Adding New Projects or Posts

Projects and posts are written in markdown ([guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)). Those files are stored in `./src/pages/projects/` and `./src/pages/posts/` respectively.
