# Encoded Objects

Encoded Objects explores how information and interactivity can augment our understandings of image & object making. These investigations re-envision our current conditions by considering the history of art and information through a technological lens. Founding members Mike Hadley and Jonathan Rockford integrate their varied experiences by merging the physical and digital realms into singular works of art.

Mike Hadley is an artist, software developer, and educator based out of Chicago, IL. Mike works and teaches at the intersection of art, technology and science. With training in both Art and Computational Neuroscience, he supports his art practice with a mixture of critical & technological skills. Mike is interested in revealing hidden systems and probing their implications - whether it is the process of genetic engineering caffeine into food or excavating the heated arguments between Wikipedia editors.

Jonathan Rockford lives and works in South Florida. With a background in sculpture, ceramics, fine-woodworking, and video art, Jonathan is intensely interested in the confluence of the physical and digital in our daily lives. When he is not teaching Art and Art History, he can be found listening to audio books & podcasts while working in his studio, cultivating his butterfly garden, or lounging with feline friends.
