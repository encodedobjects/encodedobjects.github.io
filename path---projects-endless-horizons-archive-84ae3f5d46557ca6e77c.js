While scraping panoramic images of the US coast from the NDBC’s network of camera-enabled buoys, we wondered how a computer might interpret or “see” these many beautiful, and at times tumultuous, vistas of virtually endless sea and sky. Using computer vision, each panorama has been computationally “reduced” to a series of simple color gradients and lines. The panoramic photos are only taken once per hour, so the video piece fills in the gaps of the undocumented passage of time. The questions here touch on the fine line between the mundane and the sublime, and on what may be lost and emphasized when machines take on these now endless tasks of seeing.</p>\n<h1>Sources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/buoycams.shtml">The National Buoy Data Center</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/mikewesthad/buoy-analyzer">Code repository</a></li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{date:"October 15, 2017",title:"Endless Horizons",subtitle:"Single-channel video installation, 2017"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
